# Mike's Manager README

## Background

I was born and raised in New Jersey, and I love my state. (In fact, some would say that my love of NJ is both irrational and endearing.) I went to college at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), and I received a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics in 2002, followed by a MS in Information Systems in 2004. While in college, I witnessed the expansion and burst of the first dotcom bubble first hand. I worked for a "dotcom" in 2001 right as everything fell apart, and I found myself jobless in the second semester of my senior year. I began doing consulting work for small businesses, and eventually found my way to the "web 2.0" world in 2004. I ran the tech for my friend's startup that was acquired by Bolt Media in late 2005. Ever since then, I've been involved in the NYC media world, working my way up from an engineering manager to SVP of Engineering for a multinational media company. 

Along the way, I also joined the Navy Reserves and obtained a direct commission as an Ensign in 2008. I am currently a Lieutenant Commander and drill out of Washington, DC. I deployed overseas in 2015. There is an amazing synergy between my military and civilian leadership, and I bring lessons learned from the Navy to my civilian career and vice versa. 

In 2008, I started another leadership position: as a father. I have two kids, and they are constantly teaching me new things that make me a better person.

## My Leadership Philosophy
As a manager, I am a conduit between my management and my employees; my job is to make sure that each understands the other. As a leader, I am responsible for you. I own your work, I own your actions, and I own your growth. By "own", I mean that I have a responsibility to make sure that you are doing your part to put your best foot forward. I have a responsibility to make sure you are doing a good job. I trust that if you are working for me, you are good at what you do. If your work isn't matching those expectations, that is MY fault. I am not doing something right - either I'm not properly motivating you, or I put you in a position that is not right for you. Either way, I will take ownership of that and make every effort to put you in a place where you can and will succeed. 

## What you can expect from me
I do not micromanage people, unless they require it. If they require it, it will be done insofar as I am teaching them to be more self-sufficient. Normally, I schedule weekly one-on-ones with my direct reports and bi-weekly one-on-ones with my skip level reports. That schedule can and does adjust based on our relationship and trust. I am approachable and available whenever you need me, however, and I will do anything that I can to help you. 

I don't let problems linger. Bad news doesn't get better with time. I deal with things immediately and decisively. I'm friendly and easygoing, but I am also fair and firm. 

I like to "get shit done." I don't set deadlines for the sake of setting deadlines; I want to make sure they're realistic based on actual estimates. What I don't like are amorphous projects with no defined goals or solid timelines. I have a poster in my office that says "done is better than perfect." I like to be calculated, move fast, and iterate. Which leads me to... 

I'm not perfect. I am constantly growing as an engineer, a leader, and a person. I strive for perfection, and I will be as prepared as I possibly can for every situation I put myself, my team, and you in. I will make mistakes, but I will course correct and learn from those mistakes. I ask for your patience and empathy when I do make them. 

## What I expect from you
I will push you to be your best. Let me know if I'm pushing you too hard and I will adjust. Hint: if I'm pushing you hard, it's because you're good and I trust you.

I expect you to be decisive and get things done. I expect you to communicate things to me. I want to know every single thing getting in your way, and I will get it out of your way. I expect you to grow. I expect you to periodically evaluate where you are at in your career, and I expect you to push towards making choices that will help you on your career path. You will make mistakes, too! I'll be there to help you through them and to get you back on track. 

I expect you to keep perspective - this is a job, it's not life and death. :) Enjoy yourself! Have fun, enjoy your colleagues, and stay positive.  

As the finishing line of Casablanca so eloquently put it, "I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."
